This visual novel game is a work in progress but to summarize

This visual novel asks is a disaster visual novel, there will be no dating only surviving throughout the rough landscape of the world,. It will start per-disaster go into disaster and than go into post disaster.

I don't know when this will be finished but i wanted to put up some preview images and a short description to show this game is still in development.

I won't spoil much about the plot but the game will revolve around some characters and there struggles to cope with the changing world around them. There will be SCP stuff. backrooms stuff, gore and blood, crafting, and more. I want this game to be linear but also dynamic so if you can't figure something out you can still progress

As you progress throughout the game you will be able to play as different characters, I will only work on one story line at a time though so this game will focus on a character once that is done ill work on the other character. there will be references to real life people and controversial people so be warned

So far i will reveal one character without explicitly saying there name a soldier in the military trying to fix the mess and survive. You are able to die in this game and there is perma-death so if you die as one character you will just go onto the next. This will effect the game in many ways, don't expect the game to come out any time soon...

License and copyright information will be in the full game.

There is strong language and touchy subjects in this so be warned.

Status: Coming Soon
